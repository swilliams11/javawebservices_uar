There are two files to deploy: tcWeb.war is deployed to GlassFish3 (/domains/domain1/autodeploy) and
tcService.war is deployed to Tomcat (the Ant script could be used to build afresh and deploy). Then
a browser can be opened to: 

       http://localhost:8081/tcWeb

The port number 8081 may differ on your system, depending on how you have Tomcat and GlassFish 
configured.
