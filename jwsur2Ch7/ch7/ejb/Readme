There's setup required to ensure successful deployment. When GlassFish3 is started, domain1 should
start automatically. To ensure that this is so:

  asadmin start-domain domain1

The Derby database system needs to be started independently:

  asadmin start-database

The EAR file predService.ear needs to be copied to

  /domains/domain1/autodeploy

under the GlassFish3 install directory.

The ClientEJB can be compiled and run straightforwardly; but the book explains in detail why the edit and
delete tests will work the first time but not thereafter without modification. (The reason is
that Derby manages the primary keys, which change on subsequent runs.)

The JAR file embedded in the EAR is provided. If you'd like to build the EAR from scratch, see the
book for details.
