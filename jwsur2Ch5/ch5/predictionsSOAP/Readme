The src/predictions/jaxws directory contains wsgen-generated classes to work around a bug in core Java 1.7. The
workaround should have no impact on earlier versions (famous last words...). 

The soap.war is ready to go. If you want to build from scratch:

  ant -D war.name=soap deploy
  java -jar PredictionsClient.jar moe MoeMoeMoe

A VerbosityException is thrown during client execution. You can get other exceptions by giving a bad
user/key pair, e.g., 

  java -jar PredictionsClient.jar FRED fredfredfred

generate a "FRED not registered!" fault.
