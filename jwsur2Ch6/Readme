The sample services are partitioned by chapter. The source code together with an Ant script, where applicable,
is included. Each sample includes a Readme, which provides a quick overview. The book itself has more details
about each service.

For each application, a deployable WAR or EAR file is provided where appropriate. These files either include
the source files or the source files are included in the directory. Except in JAR files, the compiled .class
files are not included. To avoid any versioning issues and to get a better feel for deployement, it's not
a bad idea to recompile and rebuild. Except for the EJB cases in Chapter 7, this can be done with the
provided Ant script, build.xml.
